are get() references really a good idea? 
	to make it work, we need to crash if we can't return a valid reference
	these references also need to not be stored. Either copy or explicitly take address
	can use try_get() or something if the get might not be there

immediate to do:
	Error logging everywhere!
	Debug logging everywhere!

	Replace direct calls to allocators with _malloc and _free
		data structures - push owned allocator then use _malloc and _free
	
	Add contexts back to _malloc and _free for allocation profiling 

	windows input
	metaprogramming - type introspection?
		replace vsnprintf

	Make concurrent vector/array/stack/hash map 
	
	OpenGl + basic voxels
	UI
	Profiling/debugging/visualization
	Actual voxel stuff

possibly imitate: loguru, dear imgui, str.h
