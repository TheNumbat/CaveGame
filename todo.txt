For overall : see #high_level_systems

are get() references really a good idea? 
	to make it work, we need to crash if we can't return a valid reference
	these references also need to not be stored. Either copy or explicitly take address
	can use try_get() or something if the get might not be there

immediate to do:

	add names to allocators?

	windows input
	metaprogramming - type introspection?
		replace vsnprintf

	Make concurrent vector/array/stack/hash map 
		usage: allocator stacks, logging contexts, job/logging queue
		basically wherever we use a mutex right now.
	
	UI
	Profiling/debugging/visualization
	OpenGL and voxel rendering

possibly imitate: dear imgui
