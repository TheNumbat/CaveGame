For overall : see #high_level_systems

are get() references really a good idea? 
	decided: they're not. Return pointers, but still crash if get() fails.
	Don't store these pointers unless you know the structure will never grow!

immediate to do:

	metaprogramming - type introspection?
		replace vsnprintf

	Make concurrent vector/array/stack/hash map 
		usage: allocator stacks, logging contexts, job/logging queue
		basically wherever we use a mutex right now.
	
	Assets
	Fonts
	UI
	Profiling/debugging/visualization
	OpenGL and voxel rendering

possibly imitate: dear imgui
