are get() references really a good idea? 
	to make it work, we need to crash if we can't return a valid reference
	these references also need to not be stored. Either copy or explicitly take address
	can use try_get() or something if the get might not be there

immediate to do:
	logging (threaded)
		error to-dos (w/ logging)
		move assert/invalid_path
	REFACTOR FILE ORGANIZATION
	windows input
	metaprogramming - type introspection?
		make own string format functions
		use for logging
	concurrent vector/array/stack/hash map - this will be important
	OpenGl + basic voxels
	UI
	Profiling/debugging/visualization
	Actual voxel stuff

possibly imitate: loguru, dear imgui, str.h
