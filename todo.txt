For overall : see #high_level_systems

immediate to do:

	asset
		asset texture atlases
		call asset.exe to re/build (do path stuff, platform_exec_cmd)
		auto-reload asset stores
		asset manager (general allocator?)

	fonts
		actually rendering text with the font atlas

	better allocator names - don't just copy

	OpenGl
		improve shader spec API
		2D
			texture atlas - fonts (texture array?)
		3D
			texture atlas/array representation/store
			chunk meshing, texturing
			deferred mesh re/building
			models & animation

	metaprogramming - struct introspection?
		replace vsnprintf

	Make concurrent vector/array/stack/hash map 
		use for allocator stacks, logging contexts, job/logging queue
		basically wherever we use a mutex right now.
