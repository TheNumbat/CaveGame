For overall : see #high_level_systems

are get() references really a good idea? 
	decided: they're not. Return pointers, but still crash if get() fails.
	Don't store these pointers unless you know the structure will never grow!

immediate to do:

	asset
		asset manager (general allocator?)
		asset fonts
		call asset.exe to re/build (do path stuff, platform_exec_cmd)
		auto-reload asset stores

	better allocator names

	metaprogramming - type introspection?
		replace vsnprintf

	Make concurrent vector/array/stack/hash map 
		usage: allocator stacks, logging contexts, job/logging queue
		basically wherever we use a mutex right now.
	
	UI
	Profiling/debugging/visualization
	OpenGL and voxel rendering

possibly imitate: dear imgui
